# employeedb
This project implements an employee database program in C. 
My program stores employee information in an array of employee structs, sorted by employee ID value. 
Employee information is read in from an input file when the program first starts.
The program prints out a menu of options, reads in the user’s input, decides which action to perform, and performs the chosen operation on the employee database. 
The options my program supports are the following:
Print the Database
Lookup by ID
Lookup by last name
Add an Employee
Quit
My program continues handling the user’s requests until the user enters 5 (i.e. the “Quit” option).
